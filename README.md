# Cake

## What is Cake?

Cake (http://cakebuild.net) is a cross platform build automation system with a C# DSL.

With Cake you can do many things such as:
* Compiling code
* Copy files/folders
* Running unit tests
* Compress files
* Build NuGet packages
* and other things...

There are many _Addins_ that you can use in Cake like: 
Docker, Code Coverage, Git, MicroServices, Postman, Powershell, and many others.
You can explore these addins [here](http://cakebuild.net/addins/).

## Why Cake?

There are many advantages to use cake such as:
* Versioning build script with source code
* You can run our build in any machine with .Net framework, Our Team City, Cloud build services etc
* Write in C#
* Unify in one file our build process
* Open source
* You don't need to version binaries

I use this extension for Visual Studio Code: Cake build script language support. Unfortunately you don't have intellisence for Cake, if you find something in the future, please advice me :-)

There is a great responsive community on [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/cake-build/cake).
